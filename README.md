üìå Project Overview

The Job Posting Analysis Project aims to extract valuable insights from job posting data by preprocessing text, analyzing trends, and predicting high-demand IT roles. Using text mining, TF-IDF vectorization, and machine learning, the project identifies which roles and categories are more in demand based on job postings data.

‚ú® Features

    Data Preprocessing:
        Clean and preprocess text data from job titles and descriptions.
        Handle missing or inconsistent salary data using median imputation.

    Text Analysis:
        Use TF-IDF Vectorization to extract important keywords and features from text data.

    Trend Analysis:
        Aggregate job categories to find the top 10 high-demand IT fields and visualize them with bar charts.

    High-Demand Prediction:
        Build a Random Forest Classifier to predict high-demand job categories based on input features.

    Feature Importance:
        Analyze which features contribute most to predicting high-demand roles.

    Visualizations:
        Generate insightful bar charts for demand trends and predictions.

üîß Technologies Used

    R Programming
        For data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning.

    Libraries:
        tm: Text mining and preprocessing.
        caret: Data splitting, dummy variable encoding, and model building.
        ggplot2: Data visualization.
        randomForest: Building the Random Forest classifier.
        dplyr: Data manipulation and aggregation.

üìÇ Dataset

The project uses a dataset of job postings containing the following columns:

    job_title: Title of the job posting.
    descriptions: Job descriptions provided in the posting.
    salary: Salary offered for the role.
    category: The job category (e.g., IT roles, administration, etc.).
    location: Location of the job posting.
    company: The name of the company offering the job.
    type: Job type (e.g., full-time, part-time).

Note: The dataset must be saved as jobstreet.csv in the directory.
üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites:

    Install R and RStudio on your system.
    Ensure the following libraries are installed in R:

    install.packages(c("tm", "caret", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "randomForest"))  

Steps to Run the Project:

    Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-posting-analysis.git  
    cd job-posting-analysis  

    Place your dataset (jobstreet.csv) in the project directory.

    Open the project in RStudio and run the script step by step.

    The script performs the following actions:
        Preprocess the data.
        Visualize the top 10 high-demand IT fields.
        Train a Random Forest model to predict high-demand roles.
        Visualize predicted high-demand categories.

üìä Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:

    Clean text data by removing punctuation, numbers, stopwords, and extra whitespaces.
    Convert salaries to numeric format and handle missing values with median imputation.

2. Feature Engineering:

    Perform TF-IDF vectorization for text columns (job_title and descriptions).
    Encode categorical columns (e.g., company, location) into dummy variables.

3. Analysis:

    Aggregate job categories to find the top 10 in-demand IT fields.
    Visualize these trends with bar charts.

4. Modeling:

    Build a Random Forest model to predict whether a job field is in "high demand."
    Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for evaluation.

5. Prediction:

    Use the trained model to predict high-demand roles for all job categories.
    Visualize the predicted high-demand fields with a bar chart.

üèÜ Results

    Top 10 High-Demand IT Job Fields:
        Visualized using a bar chart based on job posting counts.

    High-Demand Prediction:
        Achieved with a Random Forest model.
        Key features identified as most important for predictions.

    Visualizations:
        Charts for actual and predicted high-demand IT roles.

üöÄ Future Enhancements

    Integration with Web Interface:
        Build a UI to allow users to upload job datasets and view analysis.

    Geospatial Analysis:
        Visualize job demand trends on a map by location.

    Advanced Models:
        Experiment with other classifiers like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
